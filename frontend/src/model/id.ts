/** Generates a random Base64 string of length 8, for 48 bits of randomness.

This is easier on the eyes than a UUID for debugging, but still fairly random.
Note that this algorithm could be much faster if it were written from scratch,
rather than cobbling together browser APIs, and of course if we were in Rust,
we'd simply use a random 64 bit number, but unfortunately `Map<u64, T>` is not a
type well-supported by automerge, so we use `Record<string, T>` instead.
