\p{
Let #{M} be a model of a double theory with no nontrivial proarrows, i.e., a
2-theory. Then the following are equivalent:

\ul{
\li{#{M} is a discrete model}
\li{#{M} is a discrete object in the 2-category of
models, natural transformations, and modulations}
\li{As a lax functor, #{M} is normal}
}
