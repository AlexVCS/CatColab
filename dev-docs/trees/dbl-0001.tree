\title{Tabulators}
\import{macros}

\p{A \nlab{tabulator} is a kind of limit in a double category. Tabulators were
invented by Grandis and Par√© and are described in the textbook by
[Grandis](grandis-2019).}

\p{The interaction between double functors and tabulators seems not be discussed
at all in the literature. We record the basic notions here needed to make sense
of double theories with tabulators and models of such theories.}
