\p{A category with links is a category equipped with heteromorphisms that "link"
objects to morphisms. The idea is that a category with links is related to a
stock-flow diagram in the same way that a category is related to a graph.}

\definition{Category with links}{
  A \define{category with links} is a category \cat{C} equipped with a profunctor
  #{L: \cat{C} \proto \cat{C}^\to},
  where #{\cat{C}^\to} is the \nlab{arrow category} of \cat{C}.
}

\p{Let #{(\cat{C},L)} be a category with links. Given an object #{a} and a
morphism #{f: x \to y} in \cat{C}, a heteromorphim #{\ell: a \hetto f}, or
element #{\ell \in L(a,f)}, is called a \define{link from #{a} to #{f}}.}

\title{Actions on links}
\taxon{Interpretation}

\p{Since #{L} is a profunctor, links can be acted on to produce new links in the
following ways:

\ol{

\li{A link #{\ell: b \hetto f} can be pulled back along a morphism #{g: a \to b}
to give a link #{g \cdot \ell: a \hetto f}. \em{Interpretation}: if #{b} affects
#{f}, then #{a} indirectly affects #{f} because #{b} is downstream of #{a}.}

\li{A link #{\ell: a \hetto f} can be pushed forward along a morphism #{g: y \to
z} to give a link #{\ell \cdot g: a \hetto f \cdot g}. \em{Interpretation}: if
#{a} affects the flow #{f}, then #{a} also affects the composite flow #{f \cdot
g}.}

\li{A link #{\ell: a \hetto f \cdot g}, where #{x \xto{f} y \xto{g} z} are
morphisms, induces a link #{\ell / f: a \hetto g}. \em{Interpretation}: if #{a}
affects the composite flow #{f \cdot g}, then #{a} affects #{g}, either directly
or indirectly by affecting #{f}.}

}

The upshot of (2) and (3) is that if an object affects a morphism (flow), then
it also affects all flows downstream of it. This makes sense because flows are
always implicitly regulated by their source.}

\p{Categories with links are models of the following double theory.}

\title{Arrows versus twisted arrows}
\taxon{Warning}

\p{The [tabulator](dbl-0001) #{\top P} of a profunctor #{P: \cat{C} \proto
\cat{D}} is its \nlab{category of elements}, defined such that there are
projection functors #{\top P \to \cat{C}} and #{\top P \to \cat{D}}. This
category is \em{not} the same as the category of elements of #{P} viewed as a
copresheaf on #{\cat{C}^\op \times \cat{D}}, which has projections #{\int P \to
\cat{C}^\op} and #{\int P \to \cat{D}}. In particular, the tabulator of the
hom-profunctor on \cat{C} is the \nlab{arrow category}, \em{not} the
\nlab{twisted arrow category}, of \cat{C}. See also the discussion of the
\nlab{graph of a profunctor} on the nLab.}
