\p{A model of a double theory is \em{discrete} if it has no morphisms except
those that it must, such as identities.}

\p{Discreteness is not defined as directly as one might think because, at least
if we allow terminal objects in double theories, discrete models may be forced
to include non-identity morphisms as constants. An example is the unit in the
[double theory of monoids](thy-0004). This theory has exactly one discrete
model, the trivial monoid. Thus, we cannot simply define a discrete model to be
one with no non-identity morphisms. Rather than starting with a concrete
definition, we define discreteness by the universal property it is supposed to
satisfy.}

\p{In the 2-categorical special case, discrete models can formulated using an
existing bit of abstract nonsense, the notion of a
\nlab{discrete object in a 2-category}.}
