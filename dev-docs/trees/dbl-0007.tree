\p{
Let #{\cat{Lax}(\dbl{D},\dbl{E})} be the category of models of a double theory
\dbl{D} in \dbl{E}, which are structure-preserving lax functors #{F: \dbl{D} \to
\dbl{E}}, and natural transformations between them.

The \define{discrete model functor}
##{
    \Disc: \Fun(\dbl{D}_0, \dbl{E}_0) \to \cat{Lax}(\dbl{D}, \dbl{E})
}
is the left adjoint to the underlying category of objects functor
##{
    (-)_0: \begin{aligned}
      \cat{Lax}(\dbl{D}, \dbl{E}) &\to \Fun(\dbl{D}_0, \dbl{E}_0) \\
      F &\mapsto F_0 \\
      \alpha &\mapsto \alpha_0
    \end{aligned},
}
assuming the adjoint exists.

A \define{discrete model} of \dbl{D} in \dbl{E} is a model in the
image of the discrete model functor.
