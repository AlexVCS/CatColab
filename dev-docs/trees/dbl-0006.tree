\li{A discrete model of the [trivial double theory](thy-0001) is a
\nlab{discrete category}, which amounts to a set}

a pair of sets}
\li{A discrete model of the theory of pseudomonoids is a discrete monoidal category,
which amounts to a monoid}
\li{A discrete model of the theory of symmetric pseudomonoids is a discrete
symmetric monoidal category, which amounts to a commutative monoid}
