\p{The \define{theory of links} is the double theory freely generated by
\ul{
  \li{an object #{c}}
  \li{a proarrow #{\ell: c \proto \tabulator{\id_c}}.}
}}

\p{This theory is an example of a "simple double theory with tabulators," a
notion that is fairly evident even if it has not yet been formally defined.}
