/*! Pasting diagrams in double categories.

A [*pasting diagram*](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pasting+diagram) in a
categorical structure is a diagram that specifies a unique composite. In a
category, a pasting diagram is simply a [path](crate::one::path), which is why
people don't talk much about one-dimensional pasting. In higher dimensions the
combinatorics of pasting is much more complicated.

This module is about pasting in double categories, a topic not well studied.
Such work as there is tends to be topological rather than combinatorial, which
provides little guidance about implementation. We follow the philosophy if not
the technical details of Makkai in regarding "the notion of *computad*... \[as\]
nothing but the precise notion of *higher-dimensional categorical diagram*" and
singling out the pasting diagrams as those diagrams that admit a unique
top-dimensional composite (Makkai 2005; 2007). Thus, we define a "double pasting
diagram" to be a [double diagram](super::diagram) with additional data
constraining it to have a unique composite cell. This construction seems to be
original and is unfortunately not yet accompanied by a pasting theorem
establishing its correctness.

/** A pasting in a double category, with specialization for identity cells.

Like our data structure for [paths](crate::one::path::Path) in a category, this
data structure separates the identity cells specified by lower-dimensional data
as variants of an enum, even though in this case the final variant does actually
encompass the others. However, the data of a generic identity cell is so much
simpler than a general composite that the redundancy seems justified.
