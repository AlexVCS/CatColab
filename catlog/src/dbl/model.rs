/*! Models of double theories.

A model of a double theory is a category (or categories) equipped with
operations specified by the theory, categorifying the familiar idea from logic
that a model of a theory is a set (or sets) equipped with operations. For
background on double theories, see the [`theory`](super::theory) module.

In the case of a *simple* double theory, which is just a small double category,
a **model** of the theory is a span-valued *lax* double functor out of it. Such
a model is a "lax copresheaf," categorifying the notion of a copresheaf or
set-valued functor. Though they are "just" lax double functors, models are a
[concept with an
attitude](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/concept+with+an+attitude). To bring out
the intended intuition we introduce new jargon, building on that for double
theories.

# Terminology

A model of a double theory consists of elements of two kinds:

1. **Objects**, each assigned an object type in the theory;

2. **Morphisms**, each having a domain and a codomain object and assigned a
   morphism type in the theory, compatibly with the domain and codomain types;

In addition, a model has the following operations:

- **Object action**: object operations in the theory act on objects in the model
  to produce new objects;

- **Morphism action**: morphism operations in the theory act on morphisms in
  the model to produce new morphisms, compatibly with the object action;

- **Composition**: a path of morphisms in the model has a composite morphism,
  whose type is the composite of the corresponding morphism types.

/** A model of a double theory.

As always in logic, a model makes sense only relative to a theory, but a theory
can have many different models. Thus, in Rust, a model generally needs access to
its theory but should not own its theory. Implementors of this trait can use an
immutable shared reference to the theory.
