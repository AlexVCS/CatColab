/** A category.

We take the unbiased view of a category, regarding composition as an operation
on paths in the underlying graph. This has several advantages. First, it takes
as primitive the natural data structure for morphisms in a free category, or
more generally in presentations of categories. It also enables more intelligent
strategies for evaluating composites in specific categories. For instance, when
composing (multiplying) a sequence of matrices, it can be very inefficient to
fold from the left or right by binary matrix multiplication. Instead, one might
solve the "matrix chain multiplication" problem to find an optimal ordering.
